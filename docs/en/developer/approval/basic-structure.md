# Basic Data Structures

Both the main account and sub-accounts utilize the same basic structure for storing authorization-related information, with the field name being `approval`:

```
# molecule
table AccountApproval {
    action: Bytes,
    params: Bytes,
}
```

- `action` refers to the type of authorization, stored as bytes of a UTF-8 encoded string;
- `params` refers to the detailed molecule structure of various authorizations, using `Bytes` type as a container to support variable types;

## Types of Authorization

The authorizations include the following types:

- `Transfer`, which allows the transfer of account ownership to another user, see [Transfer Approval](transfer-approval.md);

## Signature Verification

This section explains the method of generating a digest for signature verification.
* For main account authorization transactions, the digest can be constructed in the same way as a regular transaction;
* For sub-accounts, due to the uniqueness of their data structure, the following algorithm is used to generate a digest;

Concatenate the following data in sequence:
- from did: UTF-8 bytes of the string;
- A hash generated by ckb-hash, created by concatenating the following fields in sequence and then hashing:
  - The `action` field, which for the main account is the transaction's action, and for the sub-account is the action field of the sub-account witness itself;
  - The molecule-encoded bytes of the `approval` field;
  - A field to prevent replay attacks:
    - For sub-accounts, concatenate the `sign_expired_at` and `nonce` fields in sequence;
